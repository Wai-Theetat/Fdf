### Things to fix

1. Color that already set from file doesn't work.
2. Color grading default look bad.
3. (x,y) scaling feel weird.
4. z height default scale is too high.



### Things to add/rm
1. no need (x,y) rotating cuz it too complicate to use, z rotate and pan is enough.
2. insead of tilting make w,s into z scaling.
3. add button that can toggle bettween default file color or program auto grading.
